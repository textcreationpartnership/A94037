            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COPIE OF A LETTER Sent to my Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and his Brethren.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY your Honour with the reſt of your Worſhipfull Brethren, with all that ſhall ſee heare or read this writing, conſider and underſtand, how that <hi>Separatiſts</hi> caled <hi>Browniſts,</hi> why they ſhould bee courted and impriſoned, for the way they walk in, I much marvel at. Truth may be blamed, but it can never be ſhamed: theſe reaſons I give for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they are a people very deſirous to make the <hi>Scripture</hi> the rule, and patterne of their lives and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156627:3"/> during their extancy in this mortall life. And King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory told Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> that thoſe men that did ſo walke as neere as the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fleſh would let them, in avoyding the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vitiouſnes of the times, hee loved immutably, and ſo do I: and ſo ſhould we all doe, if we will doe as we ought, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> rule comprehends the whole Law of <hi>God</hi> for a good Chriſtian to imitate.
<list>
                  <item>1. Is <hi>Sobriety</hi> in reſpect of ones ſelfe?</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Vprightnes</hi> in reſpect of our <hi>Chriſtian Brethren?</hi>

                  <item>3. Of <hi>Holineſſe</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> and this three-fould cord is not quickly broke.</item>
               </list> And according to theſe rules do that Sect of <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> called <hi>Browniſts</hi> walke, and thoſe good Chriſtian Proteſtants called <hi>Puritants,</hi> or <hi>round-heads prick cares</hi> walk: but ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ruffians paſt grace and good manners, with black mouthed <hi>Tertullus</hi> will bee babling: when the ſhame lieth in length of their owne haire. Is it not a ſhame for a man to weare long haire, if they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me they may Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> I have digreſſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to my m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, ſoberly, in reſpect of themſelves, and ſo are no drunkards, or at leaſt no common ones if they fall; and which of us Proteſtants doe not, in a large field; yet I am confident they riſe againe by ſerious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they live uprightly in reſpect of their Chriſtian Brethren, uſing faire and honeſt dealing betweene man and man; if there be a cloſe Hypocrite amongſt them, as <hi>Iudas</hi> amongſt the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and is

            <p>Thirdly they live holily towards <hi>God,</hi> and it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently appeareth in their frequent receiving of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and in having a reverend regard of the name of <hi>God,</hi> not daring to take it in vaine; much leſſe to curſe ſweare or blaſpheme that holy name, by which they are ſealed to the day of Redemption: beſides the Sun-day moſt properly named the <hi>Saboth</hi> day, or <hi>Lords</hi> day they celibrate, not in luxury or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneſſe, not in ryot or exceſſe, not in hobihorſing <hi>morris dancing,</hi> carding diceing bowling, wreſtling, tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſporting, gaming, or unneceſſary idleing or vain ſpending that day, or the evening thereof in unneſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie walking to take the ayre, and ſo forth: but in ſanctifying that day as the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth, &amp; as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Practice of <hi>Piety,</hi> a Book we allow good, and made by the Spirit of <hi>God:</hi> which tells that if we doe not ſanctifie that day, and every part thereof, we ſhall never keepe a <hi>Saboth</hi> with the <hi>Lord</hi> in Heaven. Me thinks whenwe conſider our neglects in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we ſhould tremble to puniſh theſe good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people by courting or impriſoning them.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object.</label> Theſe are good things, and wee like the people well, being ſo carefull to pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> but why will they not come to heare our <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> or our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preach?</p>

            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:156627:4"/>
            <p>And now becauſe they are counted, and ſaid to be by too many of us Proteſtants worſe then <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I ſhall here prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>Firſt it is one thing to erre in opinion, and tell mee which of us Proteſtants Divines, and others do not?</p>
            <p>Secondly it is another thing to erre in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall truths; in the firſt they may as wee our ſelves, in the latter for fundamentalls they doe not, and ſo are not worſe, but better then the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>

            <p>Maintaining <hi>Stewes,</hi> taking a million of mony, or more yearely by the ſin of whoredomes and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe though many more might bee named, all contrary to fundamentall truths, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold and beleeve. Now I hope never a one of us Proteſtants will ever cenfure, or acknowledge, that <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> (otherwiſe called from <hi>Browne Browniſts,</hi> as we call from <hi>Luther Lutherans,</hi> or from <hi>Calvin Calviniſts,</hi> not but they were long before ever Maſter <hi>Browne</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:156627:4"/> was) I ſay, ever beleeve any of this Sect to be guilty of theſe, or other fundamentall truths, and ſo are better then <hi>Papiſts:</hi> and ſhall I ſay, looking on our own lives and wayes, (would <hi>God</hi> I could not) better then many of us prophane, and luke-warme Proteſtants: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good to ſpeake truth, and to ſet the ſaddle on the right horſe, and I pray <hi>God</hi> grant, that wee Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants may make their lives, and actions in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe our rules and patternes to walke by, however never prove railing <hi>Rabſhakes,</hi> or ſcoffing <hi>Shimeis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our brothren, and I verily beleeve to <hi>Gods</hi> deare ones.</p>
            <p>And I am confident theſe <hi>Separatiſts</hi> called <hi>Browniſts,</hi> doe tender the perſon and welfare of his Majeſtie, ſo highly, that to doe him good and ſervice, they would ſtake eſtate and life for it: many have prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it ſeriouſly, and as really I beleeve it, and they that doe not, I queſtion whether they be good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>God,</hi> or good ſubjects to his <hi>anoynted:</hi> had this Sect ever their hearts dipt in bloud in all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or moleſtations, or were ever Traytors to the Crowne and Sate?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object.</label> They have beene kept under, and could not hurt us.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> And ſo have the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but would have hurt us; but theſe people would have endured wrong, and ſuffered patiently, knowing they have thanks with <hi>God</hi> thereunto, were they called, and if they could they would not, for their Religion is no bloudy one, and ſo long wee need not be afraid, for wee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be hurt I warrant you by them, either in eſtate or life, if there were ten times more then there are of them.</p>
